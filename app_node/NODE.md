# NODE.md

## Web Application Details

### Language Choice

I chose Node.js as the programming language for this web application. Node.js with the Express framework is suitable for
building scalable and efficient web applications. The asynchronous nature of Node.js makes it well-suited for handling
API requests.

### Best Practices and Coding Standards

I followed several best practices and coding standards to ensure the quality and maintainability of the Node.js web
application:

- **Asynchronous Code:** Leveraged the asynchronous nature of Node.js for efficient handling of API requests, ensuring
  responsiveness and scalability.

- **Modularization:** The code is organized into modular components, separating concerns for improved readability and
  maintainability.

- **EJS Templates:** Utilized EJS templates for HTML rendering, promoting the separation of concerns between the
  application logic and presentation.

- **Static Files:** Static files, such as CSS, are stored in the `public` folder, adhering to the standard structure for
  Express applications.

### Testing

The application has undergone testing to ensure its functionality and reliability:

- **Manual Testing:** Conducted manual testing to verify the correct display of Pokemon information on the main page and
  handling of potential errors.

### Code Quality

- **Readability:** The code is written using meaningful variable and function names.

- **Version Control:** The project is version-controlled using a tool like Git. This allows for tracking changes and
  rolling back to previous versions if needed.
