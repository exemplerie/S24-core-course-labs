# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for the Python web application project.

## CI Workflow Overview

The CI workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/CI.yml` file. The workflow includes two jobs: `build` and `deploy`. The `build` job is triggered on every push to the `main` and `lab3` branches. It performs linting, runs unit tests, and checks for security vulnerabilities using Snyk. The `deploy` job, triggered on the same branches, builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

## Best Practices

### Caching Dependencies

- **Objective:** Minimize dependency installation time.

- **Implementation:** Caching the Python package dependencies using GitHub Actions cache. This significantly reduces the time spent on dependency installation during each CI run.

### Python Initialization

- **Objective:** Ensure a consistent Python environment.

- **Implementation:** Using the `actions/setup-python` action to set up a specific Python version (3.11) for the CI job. This ensures a consistent Python environment across different CI runs.

### Dependency Installation

- **Objective:** Install project dependencies.

- **Implementation:** Using `pip` to install project dependencies specified in `app_python/requirements.txt`. This step ensures that the project dependencies are correctly installed before running the subsequent CI tasks.

### Code Linting

- **Objective:** Enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.

- **Implementation:** Utilizing Flake8 for linting. The linting process checks for issues related to code complexity, line length, and adherence to PEP 8 style guide.

### Unit Testing

- **Objective:** Verify the correctness of specific functions and features.

- **Implementation:** Running unit tests using the `pytest` framework. This ensures that changes to the codebase do not introduce regressions and maintains the expected behavior.

### Security Checks

- **Objective:** Identify and address security vulnerabilities.

- **Implementation:** Integrating Snyk for security checks. Snyk scans the project for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and provides insights to address potential security risks.

### Docker Image Build and Push

- **Objective:** Package the application in a Docker image and make it accessible.

- **Implementation:** Building a Docker image, tagging it, and pushing it to Docker Hub. This process ensures that the application can be deployed easily, and the Docker image is versioned for future reference.

## Conclusion

The implemented CI best practices aim to enhance the reliability, security, and maintainability of the Python web application. Regularly running these CI tasks helps catch issues early in the development process and ensures a smooth deployment workflow.
